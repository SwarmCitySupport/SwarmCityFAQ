# What Is Swarm City?

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Swarm City is a decentralized commerce platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">It is our goal to provide a platform featuring an open global marketplace of services/service providers, currency tokens, and encrypted communication tools that offer direct access between buyers and sellers worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">In the swarm.city DApp, you get access to a global decentralized metwork of peer-to-peer (P2P) service providers and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"> Anyone can also easily create their own brands and hives, and start doing P2P transactions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">To accomplish this, swarm.city combines the power of blockchain technology, open-source development, platform cooperativism, and a decentralized &lsquo;swarm&rsquo; organizational model open to all.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">The core technical offering is a DApp running on the Ethereum blockchain. </span></p>

<ul class="postList">
<li id="6e7e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><span style="font-size: large;">Swarm City is a decentralized swarm of people who believe in changing the world through enabling peer to peer transactions. We express our value through SWT, a token on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></li>
<li id="8f0d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe every human being should have access to a marketplace to exchange their created value, and be able to transact freely with any other human being, without third party involvement.</span></li>
<li id="91bc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We don&rsquo;t have leaders, founders, or managers&hellip; we don&rsquo;t believe in titles. People who create value don&rsquo;t need titles, they have reputation and actions to support it.</span></li>
<li id="dc69" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We have a dedicated core team of people&nbsp;with the combined skill-sets needed to kickstart this decentralized community.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li id="7776" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe in Swarmwise principles and voluntarism, and organize and act in non-coercive ways.</span></li>
<li id="1663" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe in open-source creation, and sharing knowledge and ideas freely.</span></li>
<li id="4399" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe that the person who spots a problem is probably best suited to solve it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p id="7920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">As our city grows, reputation will be the compass that identifies leaders in Swarm City. A fancy title like founder, or leader has no value. The true organizers will be known by their reputation in maintaining hashtags, and by running hives.</span></p>

# Why build Swarm City?
<p><span style="font-size: large;">We are building Swarm City so people can transact with each other without third party interference. #Freedom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Using Swarm City removes the need for third party intermediaries allowing every user to transact without obstruction. In doing so, transaction costs are greatly reduced, and there is no more need for users to trust third parties with their personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Building decentralized apps (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain has the potential to distrupt many global markets and industries including banking and payments, cyber security, supply chain management, forecasting, networking and the Internet of Things, insurance, private transportation and ridesharing, cloud storage, charity, voting government, public benefits, healthcare, online music distribution, retail, real estate, crowdfunding, and any industry that deals with data or transactions of any kind.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">To find out how we think we can use the blockchain to change the world read our Medium article, "<a href="https://press.swarm.city/cutting-out-the-middlemen-318dae0ed8cb">Cutting Out the Middleman</a>"</span></p>

# Why is Swarm City built on the Ethereum blockchain?
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">We had several reasons for choosing to build the Swarm City DApp on the Ethereum blockchain opposed to building our own blockchain or using another:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">It gives us the ability to create reputation for each transaction we do. When SWT is transacted over a hashtag (smart contract) the people transacting get reputation on that hashtag. So, say in a rideshare scenario, a driver and a rider who transact on #needaride both get reputation for successfully completing the deal. That can&rsquo;t happen in our ecosystem if SWT isn&rsquo;t used.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">There is a need to have economic incentives of participants in the platform aligned.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">To eventually insulate the community from value fluctuations of other currencies.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">It is a way to make the platform sticky. Since the value of SWT is closely linked to the success of Swarm City the participants are invested in the success of the ecosystem. That's not possible if you use ETH.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em><span style="font-size: large;">"Looking at flocks of birds doing their aerial ballet around the trees in autumn is amazing.

<p id="8bb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em><span style="font-size: large;">Swarm City acted as a magnet for like-minded people, who all found a common sense of belonging.

# Why did Swarm City brand fork?
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span>There are 2 key reasons for the brand fork:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"><span>the ARC symbol was already in use by some other coins and the previous token contract cannot be renamed </span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"><span>the ARC symbol would not have suited the new branding</span></span></li>
</ol>

# Is there a project roadmap for v1?
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">The Swarm City team planned 3 releases:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">1. Terminal, released on February 18, 2017, is the first big step toward building a decentralized economy. It gives users the ability to:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">create a user profile/digital wallet</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">view balances</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">send and receive SWT with simple shortcodes</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">convert ARC to SWT</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Read "<a href="https://press.swarm.city/first-release-details-on-the-token-swap-20e03f1b7da6">First Release and Details on the Token Swap</a>" for more details</span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">2. Boardwalk, our Minimal Viable Product (MVP) was released on June 15, 2017. It provides users with a marketplace to communicate and transact within, called #pioneer. It gives users the ability to:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">complete basic peer-to-peer transactions on the first hashtag, #pioneer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">create an offer, ask the global audience for any thing or service, in exchange for the amount of SWT you offer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">generate Swarm City Reputation tokens, receive reputation tokens (SWR) for all completed transactions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">help fund the City with the hashtag maintainer fee deducted from each transaction. These funds are used to fund support, communication, and conflict resolution for this hashtag</span></li>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">3. Storefront, Swarm City "Hives" begin to organize and offer services on the platform. Context dependent GUIs providing users access to many individual marketplaces are established providing users with:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">the ability to create and maintain their own hashtag</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">access to all other hashtags (marketplaces) in Swarm City</span></li>
