<p><span style="font-size: large;">It is our goal to provide a platform featuring an open global marketplace of services/service providers, currency tokens, and encrypted communication tools that offer direct access between buyers and sellers worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">In the swarm.city DApp, you get access to a global decentralized metwork of peer-to-peer (P2P) service providers and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"> Anyone can also easily create their own brands and hives, and start doing P2P transactions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">To accomplish this, swarm.city combines the power of blockchain technology, open-source development, platform cooperativism, and a decentralized &lsquo;swarm&rsquo; organizational model open to all.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">The core technical offering is a DApp running on the Ethereum blockchain. </span></p>

<li id="6e7e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><span style="font-size: large;">Swarm City is a decentralized swarm of people who believe in changing the world through enabling peer to peer transactions. We express our value through SWT, a token on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></li>
<li id="8f0d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe every human being should have access to a marketplace to exchange their created value, and be able to transact freely with any other human being, without third party involvement.</span></li>

<li id="dc69" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We have a dedicated core team of people&nbsp;with the combined skill-sets needed to kickstart this decentralized community.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li id="7776" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe in Swarmwise principles and voluntarism, and organize and act in non-coercive ways.</span></li>
<li id="1663" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe in open-source creation, and sharing knowledge and ideas freely.</span></li>

<p id="7920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">As our city grows, reputation will be the compass that identifies leaders in Swarm City. A fancy title like founder, or leader has no value. The true organizers will be known by their reputation in maintaining hashtags, and by running hives.</span></p>

# Why build Swarm City?
<p><span style="font-size: large;">We are building Swarm City so people can transact with each other without third party interference. #Freedom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Using Swarm City removes the need for third party intermediaries allowing every user to transact without obstruction. In doing so, transaction costs are greatly reduced, and there is no more need for users to trust third parties with their personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Building decentralized apps (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain has the potential to distrupt many global markets and industries including banking and payments, cyber security, supply chain management, forecasting, networking and the Internet of Things, insurance, private transportation and ridesharing, cloud storage, charity, voting government, public benefits, healthcare, online music distribution, retail, real estate, crowdfunding, and any industry that deals with data or transactions of any kind.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">To find out how we think we can use the blockchain to change the world read our Medium article, "<a href="https://press.swarm.city/cutting-out-the-middlemen-318dae0ed8cb">Cutting Out the Middleman</a>"</span></p>

# Why is Swarm City built on the Ethereum blockchain?
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">We had several reasons for choosing to build the Swarm City DApp on the Ethereum blockchain opposed to building our own blockchain or using another:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">It gives us the ability to create reputation for each transaction we do. When SWT is transacted over a hashtag (smart contract) the people transacting get reputation on that hashtag. So, say in a rideshare scenario, a driver and a rider who transact on #needaride both get reputation for successfully completing the deal. That can&rsquo;t happen in our ecosystem if SWT isn&rsquo;t used.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">There is a need to have economic incentives of participants in the platform aligned.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">To eventually insulate the community from value fluctuations of other currencies.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">It is a way to make the platform sticky. Since the value of SWT is closely linked to the success of Swarm City the participants are invested in the success of the ecosystem. That's not possible if you use ETH.</span></li>
</ul>

# Why did Swarm City brand fork?
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span>There are 2 key reasons for the brand fork:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"><span>the ARC symbol was already in use by some other coins and the previous token contract cannot be renamed </span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"><span>the ARC symbol would not have suited the new branding</span></span></li>
</ol>

# Is there a project roadmap for v1?
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">The Swarm City team planned 3 releases:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">1. Terminal, released on February 18, 2017, is the first big step toward building a decentralized economy. It gives users the ability to:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">create a user profile/digital wallet</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">view balances</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">send and receive SWT with simple shortcodes</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">convert ARC to SWT</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Read "<a href="https://press.swarm.city/first-release-details-on-the-token-swap-20e03f1b7da6">First Release and Details on the Token Swap</a>" for more details</span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">2. Boardwalk, our Minimal Viable Product (MVP) was released on June 15, 2017. It provides users with a marketplace to communicate and transact within, called #pioneer. It gives users the ability to:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">complete basic peer-to-peer transactions on the first hashtag, #pioneer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">create an offer, ask the global audience for any thing or service, in exchange for the amount of SWT you offer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">generate Swarm City Reputation tokens, receive reputation tokens (SWR) for all completed transactions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">help fund the City with the hashtag maintainer fee deducted from each transaction. These funds are used to fund support, communication, and conflict resolution for this hashtag</span></li>

# What is a DApp?
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: large;">DApp is an abbreviation for Decentralized Application. DApps connect users and providers directly.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Swarm City is listed on the <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/swarm-city">State of DApps</a> site</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/383/what-is-a-dapp">The Ethereum Stack Exchange</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;">explains it like this...</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: large;">A DApp runs backend code on a global decentralized peer-to-peer network. Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers. A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) that can make calls to it&rsquo;s backend&nbsp;since Ethereum contracts are code that run on the global Ethereum decentralized network.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: large;">A traditional app = "frontend + servers"</span></p>
<p dir="ltrln"><span style="font-size: large;">A DApp = "frontend + contracts"</span></p>

# Is the Swarm City DApp downloadable in Google or Apple appstore?
<p dir="ltr">No, we will not build a native app, as it would create a single point of failure in the app stores. However, Swarm City will be accessible through native apps like status.im.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://themerkle.com/what-is-a-dapp/">The Merkle</a> reports&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>"Decentralized applications also known as DApps, are the next logical step in the evolution of technology. A decentralized application is similar to a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, yet it also has key differences. Unlike smart contracts, Dapps do not need to revolve around finance but can leverage blockchain technology for any purpose that comes to mind."</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://ca.newsbtc.com/decentralized-apps-for-beginners-what-is-a-dapp/">NEWSBTC</a> explains it like this</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>"Decentralized apps are a new type of software program designed to exist on the Internet in a way that is not controlled by any single entity. Where&nbsp;bitcoin is a decentralized value exchange, a decentralized application aims to achieve functionality&nbsp;beyond transactions that exchange value. Many types of decentralized apps are starting to emerge as blockchain technology continues to progress. More companies and individuals are seeing the potential for what can be achieved in decentralizing not just money but almost any type of computing imaginable.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Decentralized apps potentially represent the next generation of computing. In a completely decentralized world all things occur using peer-to-peer networks and the idea of centralized entities&nbsp;are non-existent. This distributed future is still being designed and built but the early stages of development are looking promising."</strong></em></p>

# How does a decentralized commerce platform work?
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: large;">Commerce happens when two or more people trade goods or services for other things of value like cash or cryptocurrency and it requires two things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><span><span style="font-size: large;">the ability to communicate</span></span></li>
<li dir="ltr"><span><span style="font-size: large;">the ability to transact</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span style="font-size: large;">Swarm City enables people to securely communicate and transact in a completely decentralized way - without the middlemen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">Users can create a profile and digital wallet, convert ARC to SWT, send and receive SWT, see the SWT and ether balance and the equivalent USD value, place an offer, communicate privately, and complete a transaction exchanging SWT.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span>More details can be found in "</span><a href="https://press.swarm.city/system-architecture-newsflash-449fea309097">System Architect Newsflash</a><span>"</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Creating a blockchain based app that&rsquo;s fast and as responsive as a bee is hard. That&rsquo;s why the Swarm City architecture consists of several layers that interoperate, to create an experience that enables a decentralized peer to peer sharing economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The protocol is the most important part; making sure layers can communicate by speaking the same language using the same grammatical rules. These layers are isolated so they can be changed without disabling the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">One of these layers enables the communication between devices, the blockchain, and IPFS. Before data is stored on IPFS or the Ethereum blockchain, it needs to be available on every user&rsquo;s device so it can interact with it. In the current live version, this part is played by Whisper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">With the development and release of Boardwalk (June 2017) the dev team reached and pushed the limits of what you can use Whisper for today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">To create an awesome user experience, Boardwalk 2.0 will use Firebase to enable the communication layer. In the meantime our dev and lab teams keep working on optimizing the Whisper solution, and when ready, will swap out the components on this layer.&nbsp;<span>Firebase knows what&rsquo;s going to be on IPFS before it&rsquo;s there. But it needs to have the hash later on, so everyone can verify what is true.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"> IPFS stores all data &mdash; Firebase caches </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">There is a unique IPFS bridge constructed within Firebase, and its function is to listen to changes made to the Firebase database and storage. This bridge is a caching layer and hash index to the IPFS. All changes to Firebase will be saved to IPFS, and IPFS will generate a hash from the data, which in turn is saved back to Firebase updating the stored data with the IPFS hash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Data is stored in the browser&rsquo;s local storage via IndexedDB and Firebase database. This data is then synced to the IPFS. Firebase functions trigger updates to the Blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Public servers are used to interacting with geth, leaving the app completely infrastructure free with exception of the IPFS server.</span></p>
