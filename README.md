# What Is Swarm City?

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Swarm City is a decentralized commerce platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">It is our goal to provide a platform featuring an open global marketplace of services/service providers, currency tokens, and encrypted communication tools that offer direct access between buyers and sellers worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">In the swarm.city DApp, you get access to a global decentralized metwork of peer-to-peer (P2P) service providers and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"> Anyone can also easily create their own brands and hives, and start doing P2P transactions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">To accomplish this, swarm.city combines the power of blockchain technology, open-source development, platform cooperativism, and a decentralized &lsquo;swarm&rsquo; organizational model open to all.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">The core technical offering is a DApp running on the Ethereum blockchain. </span></p>

<li id="6e7e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><span style="font-size: large;">Swarm City is a decentralized swarm of people who believe in changing the world through enabling peer to peer transactions. We express our value through SWT, a token on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></li>
<li id="8f0d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe every human being should have access to a marketplace to exchange their created value, and be able to transact freely with any other human being, without third party involvement.</span></li>
<li id="91bc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We don&rsquo;t have leaders, founders, or managers&hellip; we don&rsquo;t believe in titles. People who create value don&rsquo;t need titles, they have reputation and actions to support it.</span></li>
<li id="dc69" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We have a dedicated core team of people&nbsp;with the combined skill-sets needed to kickstart this decentralized community.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li id="7776" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe in Swarmwise principles and voluntarism, and organize and act in non-coercive ways.</span></li>
<li id="1663" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe in open-source creation, and sharing knowledge and ideas freely.</span></li>
<li id="4399" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">We believe that the person who spots a problem is probably best suited to solve it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p id="7920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><span style="font-size: large;">As our city grows, reputation will be the compass that identifies leaders in Swarm City. A fancy title like founder, or leader has no value. The true organizers will be known by their reputation in maintaining hashtags, and by running hives.</span></p>

# Why build Swarm City?
<p><span style="font-size: large;">We are building Swarm City so people can transact with each other without third party interference. #Freedom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Using Swarm City removes the need for third party intermediaries allowing every user to transact without obstruction. In doing so, transaction costs are greatly reduced, and there is no more need for users to trust third parties with their personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Building decentralized apps (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain has the potential to distrupt many global markets and industries including banking and payments, cyber security, supply chain management, forecasting, networking and the Internet of Things, insurance, private transportation and ridesharing, cloud storage, charity, voting government, public benefits, healthcare, online music distribution, retail, real estate, crowdfunding, and any industry that deals with data or transactions of any kind.&nbsp;</span></p>

# Why is Swarm City built on the Ethereum blockchain?
<p><span><span style="font-size: large;">We had several reasons for choosing to build the Swarm City DApp on the Ethereum blockchain opposed to building our own blockchain or using another:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">It gives us the ability to create reputation for each transaction we do. When SWT is transacted over a hashtag (smart contract) the people transacting get reputation on that hashtag. So, say in a rideshare scenario, a driver and a rider who transact on #needaride both get reputation for successfully completing the deal. That can&rsquo;t happen in our ecosystem if SWT isn&rsquo;t used.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">There is a need to have economic incentives of participants in the platform aligned.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span style="font-size: large;">To eventually insulate the community from value fluctuations of other currencies.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">It is a way to make the platform sticky. Since the value of SWT is closely linked to the success of Swarm City the participants are invested in the success of the ecosystem. That's not possible if you use ETH.</span></li>
</ul>
